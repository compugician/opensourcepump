This repository holds work being done towards an open source breast pump, as result of the MIT Media Lab's "Make the Breast Pump not Suck" Hackathon.

Currently it contains the initial version of the Silicone Diaphragm Adapter, which fit the Ameda Silicone Diaphragms, and contain a generic port on each side.

Improvements need to be made for interlocking of the two parts, as well as wall-thickness for printing on FormLabs printers.

Tests on the Medela Pump-in-Style suggest that using two adapters (in parallel) might be required to support the full range of pressure. 

Please contact breastpump-organizers@media.mit.edu and/or tal@media.mit.edu for further details, or if you are interested in collaboration.
